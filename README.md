# JavaScript Division by Zero Bug

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: division by zero. The `bug.js` file contains code that attempts to divide two numbers, but it does not properly handle the case where the divisor is zero.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

## How to reproduce the bug:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js` with a divisor of 0. You'll see an error.

## Solution:
The solution is to add a check that explicitly prevents division by zero.
